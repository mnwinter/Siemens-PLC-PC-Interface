# Reusable Equipment Gallery help

Scene ID: `equipment-gallery`  
Migrated source: `prototype/scenes/equipment-gallery.json`  
Scene contract: `res://scenes/migrated/equipment-gallery.scene.json`

## Purpose

A visual inventory of the current primitive-built assets. Every item is created by the same asset factory used by runtime-loaded scenes.

## Expected I/O to operate this scene

All entries below are symbolic scene points. They are not `%I`, `%Q`, DB, or hardware addresses. PC-owned points are simulator feedback; PLC-owned points are commands supplied by the controller; SIM points are internal and should not be wired as external I/O.

| Point | Type | Owner | Initial value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gallery_animation` | `BOOL` | **SIM** | `False` |
| `industrial_fan_run` | `BOOL` | **SIM** | `False` |
| `emergency_stop` | `BOOL` | **SIM** | `False` |
| `demo_tank_level` | `REAL` | **SIM** | `50` |
| `demo_level_signal` | `REAL` | **SIM** | `12` |

## Operator actions

No operator action contract is declared.

## Equipment bindings

No point-to-equipment bindings are declared.
