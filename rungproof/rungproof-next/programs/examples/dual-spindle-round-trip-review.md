# Dual-spindle round-trip review

`dual-spindle-round-trip-review.rpproj.json` is a separate offline diagnostic example for `lab-2-22-dual-spindle`. It is not automatically loaded and is not the training exercise solution.

Open the dual-spindle scene in the Windows visual-review app. In Logic Editor use Project > Open, select this file, then Online > Verify + load offline. Expected: one block/task, 13 rungs, 21 tags. Return to Scene, enable Hold offline plant clock, Run, then press Start dual-spindle cycle. Run alone must leave the plant home.

Use Step 0.5 s to review motion, and Step 20 ms near transitions. The QA drives both feeds, retracts A before B, extends only after both measured homes, waits one second at actual transfer_at_end, then explicitly requests return until actual transfer_home. Expected: the shared fixture returns along its supporting bed and stays home without re-extending. Inspect FR/FL/RL/RR/Top while held during return, then Stop and Reset.

Opening the editor releases the visual-review Hold. Stop before checking the watch table when the pose must remain fixed. Expected final watch values: qa_return TRUE, transfer_home TRUE, transfer_at_end FALSE, transfer_retract FALSE. The timer symbol qa_return_delay displays its ET/Q; do not add qa_return_delay.Q as a separately declared watch symbol.

Native validation to date: normal Open/Verify+load, actual Run/Start, returned-home pose and final latch/feedback were observed. Intermediate return-path multi-angle clearance remains unverified. No physical PLC was connected or written.
