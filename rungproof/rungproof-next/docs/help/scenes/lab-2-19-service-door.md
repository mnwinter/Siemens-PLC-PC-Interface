# Lab 2.19 - Service Door Shutter help

Scene ID: `lab-2-19-service-door`  
Migrated source: `prototype/scenes/lab-2-19-service-door.plcscene`  
Scene contract: `res://scenes/migrated/lab-2-19-service-door.scene.json`

## Purpose

Open, close, and stop commands move a service-door shutter between normally-closed cable-monitored limits.

## Expected I/O to operate this scene

All entries below are symbolic scene points. They are not `%I`, `%Q`, DB, or hardware addresses. PC-owned points are simulator feedback; PLC-owned points are commands supplied by the controller; SIM points are internal and should not be wired as external I/O.

| Point | Type | Owner | Initial value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `motor_open` | `BOOL` | **PLC** | `False` |
| `motor_close` | `BOOL` | **PLC** | `False` |
| `open_limit_nc` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `True` |
| `closed_limit_nc` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `False` |
| `door_position` | `REAL` | **SIM** | `100` |
| `cycle_complete` | `BOOL` | **SIM** | `False` |

## Operator actions

| Action | Type | Bound point/sequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Open service door` | `start` | `open` |
| `Close service door` | `start` | `close` |
| `Immediate stop` | `stop` | `` |
| `Reset door` | `reset` | `` |

## Equipment bindings

| Symbolic point | Equipment | Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `motor_open` | `service_shutter` | `running` |
| `motor_close` | `service_shutter` | `running` |
| `open_limit_nc` | `door_open_lamp` | `indicator` |
| `closed_limit_nc` | `door_closed_lamp` | `indicator` |

## Expected equipment

| ID | Type | Label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `service_shutter` | `rollerShutter` | Service door shutter |
| `door_open_button` | `switch` | Open door |
| `door_stop_button` | `switch` | Stop door |
| `door_close_button` | `switch` | Close door |
| `door_open_lamp` | `indicator` | Door open limit |
| `door_closed_lamp` | `indicator` | Door closed limit |

## Stop and safety boundary

A normal Stop removes PLC-owned commands according to the scene runtime. This document does not prove a safety function, a real E-stop circuit, a PLC watchdog, or live-machine commissioning.

Declared simulation safe state:

| Point | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `motor_open` | `False` |
| `motor_close` | `False` |

## Machine guide

Open, close, and stop commands move a service-door shutter between normally-closed cable-monitored limits.

### Start conditions

- The common PLC/watchdog foundation is healthy.
- All required simulator inputs are at their documented initial state.
- The PLC is ready to command motor_open, motor_close.

### Normal sequence

- opening
- open limit

### Expected observations

- Each direction stops at its limit; open and close outputs are never on together.
