# Lab 2.16 - Fixture-Safe Drill Station help

Scene ID: `lab-2-16-safe-drill`  
Migrated source: `prototype/scenes/lab-2-16-safe-drill.plcscene`  
Scene contract: `res://scenes/migrated/lab-2-16-safe-drill.scene.json`

## Purpose

A guarded drill cycle requires a present workpiece and both hand-request inputs before the spindle can descend.

## Expected I/O to operate this scene

All entries below are symbolic scene points. They are not `%I`, `%Q`, DB, or hardware addresses. PC-owned points are simulator feedback; PLC-owned points are commands supplied by the controller; SIM points are internal and should not be wired as external I/O.

| Point | Type | Owner | Initial value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `left_hand_request` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `False` |
| `right_hand_request` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `False` |
| `workpiece_present` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `True` |
| `drill_run` | `BOOL` | **PLC** | `False` |
| `drill_at_bottom` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `False` |
| `drill_at_top` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `True` |
| `cycle_color` | `STRING` | **SIM** | `amber` |
| `cycle_complete` | `BOOL` | **SIM** | `False` |

## Operator actions

| Action | Type | Bound point/sequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Toggle left hand request` | `togglePoint` | `left_hand_request` |
| `Toggle right hand request` | `togglePoint` | `right_hand_request` |
| `Start guarded drill cycle` | `start` | `drill-cycle` |
| `Stop and retract` | `stop` | `` |
| `Reset drill` | `reset` | `` |

## Equipment bindings

| Symbolic point | Equipment | Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `left_hand_request` | `left_hand_button` | `switch` |
| `right_hand_request` | `right_hand_button` | `switch` |
| `drill_run` | `safe_drill` | `running` |
| `cycle_color` | `drill_status` | `indicator` |

## Expected equipment

| ID | Type | Label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `safe_drill` | `drillPress` | Guarded drill press |
| `drill_workpiece` | `box` | Clamped workpiece |
| `left_hand_button` | `switch` | Left hand request |
| `right_hand_button` | `switch` | Right hand request |
| `drill_cycle_button` | `switch` | Initiate guarded cycle |
| `drill_status` | `indicator` | Drill status |

## Stop and safety boundary

A normal Stop removes PLC-owned commands according to the scene runtime. This document does not prove a safety function, a real E-stop circuit, a PLC watchdog, or live-machine commissioning.

Declared simulation safe state:

| Point | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `drill_run` | `False` |
| `cycle_color` | `red` |

## Machine guide

A guarded drill cycle requires a present workpiece and both hand-request inputs before the spindle can descend.

### Start conditions

- The common PLC/watchdog foundation is healthy.
- All required simulator inputs are at their documented initial state.
- The PLC is ready to command drill_run.

### Normal sequence

- spindle start
- drilling
- bottom dwell
- retracting
- cycle complete

### Expected observations

- Start is blocked without both requests; a valid cycle drills, retracts, and stops at top.
