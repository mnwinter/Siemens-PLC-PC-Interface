# Lab 11.7 - Multi-Conveyor Pallet Route help

Scene ID: `lab-11-07-multi-conveyor-pallet-route`  
Migrated source: `prototype/scenes/lab-11-07-multi-conveyor-pallet-route.plcscene`  
Scene contract: `prototype/scenes/lab-11-07-multi-conveyor-pallet-route.plcscene`

## Purpose

Several conveyor zones start only from a clear leading edge and stop together from a common stop request.

## Expected I/O to operate this scene

All entries below are symbolic scene points. They are not `%I`, `%Q`, DB, or hardware addresses. PC-owned points are simulator feedback; PLC-owned points are commands supplied by the controller; SIM points are internal and should not be wired as external I/O.

| Point | Type | Owner | Initial value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `zone_1_clear` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `False` |
| `zone_2_clear` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `False` |
| `zone_3_clear` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `False` |
| `zone_1_run` | `BOOL` | **PLC** | `False` |
| `zone_2_run` | `BOOL` | **PLC** | `False` |
| `zone_3_run` | `BOOL` | **PLC** | `False` |

## Stop and safety boundary

A normal Stop removes PLC-owned commands according to the scene runtime. This document does not prove a safety function, a real E-stop circuit, a PLC watchdog, or live-machine commissioning.

## Machine guide

Several conveyor zones start only from a clear leading edge and stop together from a common stop request.

### Start conditions

- The common PLC/watchdog foundation is healthy.
- All required simulator inputs are at their documented initial state.

### Normal sequence

- Apply the requested input condition.
- Verify only the documented PLC outputs respond.

### Expected observations

- A blocked zone removes the affected run command while preserving a diagnosable handoff state.
