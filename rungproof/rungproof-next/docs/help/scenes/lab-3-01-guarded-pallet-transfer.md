# Lab 3.1 - Guarded Pallet Transfer help

Scene ID: `lab-3-01-guarded-pallet-transfer`  
Migrated source: `prototype/scenes/lab-3-01-guarded-pallet-transfer.plcscene`  
Scene contract: `res://scenes/migrated/lab-3-01-guarded-pallet-transfer.scene.json`

## Purpose

A pallet transfer lane runs only while the access protection and clear-path inputs agree.

## Expected I/O to operate this scene

All entries below are symbolic scene points. They are not `%I`, `%Q`, DB, or hardware addresses. PC-owned points are simulator feedback; PLC-owned points are commands supplied by the controller; SIM points are internal and should not be wired as external I/O.

| Point | Type | Owner | Initial value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `guard_closed` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `False` |
| `entry_clear` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `False` |
| `exit_clear` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `False` |
| `transfer_run` | `BOOL` | **PLC** | `False` |
| `transfer_permissive` | `BOOL` | **PLC** | `False` |
| `carton_position` | `REAL` | **PC** | `-5.9` |
| `entry_carton_present` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `False` |
| `exit_carton_present` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `False` |
| `transfer_complete` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `False` |

## Stop and safety boundary

A normal Stop removes PLC-owned commands according to the scene runtime. This document does not prove a safety function, a real E-stop circuit, a PLC watchdog, or live-machine commissioning.

## Machine guide

A pallet transfer lane runs only while the access protection and clear-path inputs agree.

### Start conditions

- The common PLC/watchdog foundation is healthy.
- All required simulator inputs are at their documented initial state.

### Normal sequence

- Apply the requested input condition.
- Verify only the documented PLC outputs respond.

### Expected observations

- The transfer runs only with protection closed and both path sensors clear.
