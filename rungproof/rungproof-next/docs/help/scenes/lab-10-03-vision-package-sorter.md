# Lab 10.3 - Vision Package Sorter help

Scene ID: `lab-10-03-vision-package-sorter`  
Migrated source: `prototype/scenes/lab-10-03-vision-package-sorter.plcscene`  
Scene contract: `prototype/scenes/lab-10-03-vision-package-sorter.plcscene`

## Purpose

A vision result routes packages to one of four destination lanes using a conveyor and actuator handshake.

## Expected I/O to operate this scene

All entries below are symbolic scene points. They are not `%I`, `%Q`, DB, or hardware addresses. PC-owned points are simulator feedback; PLC-owned points are commands supplied by the controller; SIM points are internal and should not be wired as external I/O.

| Point | Type | Owner | Initial value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `package_present` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `False` |
| `vision_result_valid` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `False` |
| `destination_clear` | `BOOL` | **PC** | `False` |
| `sort_conveyor_run` | `BOOL` | **PLC** | `False` |
| `diverter_enable` | `BOOL` | **PLC** | `False` |

## Operator actions

| Action | Type | Bound point/sequence |

| `Toggle package present` | `toggle` | `package_present` |
| `Toggle vision result valid` | `toggle` | `vision_result_valid` |

## Stop and safety boundary

A normal Stop removes PLC-owned commands according to the scene runtime. This document does not prove a safety function, a real E-stop circuit, a PLC watchdog, or live-machine commissioning.

## Machine guide

A vision result routes packages to one of four destination lanes using a conveyor and actuator handshake.

### Start conditions

- The common PLC/watchdog foundation is healthy.
- All required simulator inputs are at their documented initial state.

### Normal sequence

- Apply the requested input condition.
- Verify only the documented PLC outputs respond.

### Expected observations

- Sorting is enabled only for a present package with a valid vision result and clear destination.
